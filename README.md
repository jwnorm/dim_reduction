# Dimensionality Reduction

> **Note:** This repo is related to my fifth and final homework assignment for ISE537 at NC State University.

## Overview

This project primarily concerns **P**rincipal **C**omponents **A**nalysis (PCA). The Quarto Document walks through coding custom functions to perform PCA via eigen decomposition and **S**ingular **V**alue **D**ecomposition (SVD) on a matrix $\tilde{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{20 \times 10}$. To conclude, the results are validated against the `R` function `stats::prcomp`.
